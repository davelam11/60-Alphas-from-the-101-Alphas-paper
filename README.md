# 60-Alphas-from-the-101-Alphas-paper
In this repo I use python to transform 60 out of 101 quantitative alphas for stocks addressed in the "101 Formulaic Alphas" paper

These alphas requires time-series historical data from a particular stock and for some alphas, additional data such as an array of stock industry groups
may also be needed.
